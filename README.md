Our work focuses on understanding of bearing health through ML-based vibration monitoring. As bearings form primary components of all mechanical equipment, effective bearing health monitoring is essential for avoiding overhead costs and to efficiently run manufacturing processes.
We employ various Deep learning models- custom Artificial Neural Networks and LSTM based models to accurately detect a fault in bearings.
